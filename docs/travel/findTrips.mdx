# findTrips

```javascript
(from: string, to: string, date?: Date | string | number) => Promise<Array<TripPattern>>
```

Finds up to 5 trip patterns from `from` to `to` at the time specified. This is a convenience method, which first tries to find locations for the given `from` and `to` strings before searching for trips between them. If you need more control, see the [`getTripPatterns`](/travel/getTripPatterns) method.

If no locations are found for either `from` or `to`, or if `date` is invalid, an error will be thrown.

## Parameters

### from (`string`)
The place you want to search from. For instance `"Oslo"`

### to (`string`)
The place you want to search from. For instance `"Bergen"`

### date (`Date | string | number`) [Optional]
The wanted time of departure. Can be anything that is parseable by `new Date()`. If not provided, the search will be from "now".

## Example

```javascript
import EnturService, { convertFeatureToLocation } from '@entur/sdk'

const service = new EnturService({
    clientName: 'awesomecompany-awesomeapp'
})

async function printTripPatterns() {
    const [fromFeature] = await service.getFeatures('Ryllikvegen, Lillehammer')
    const [toFeature] = await service.getFeatures('Oslo S')

    if (!fromFeature || !toFeature) {
        return
    }

    const tripPatterns = await service.getTripPatterns({
        searchDate: new Date(),
        from: convertFeatureToLocation(fromFeature),
        to: convertFeatureToLocation(toFeature),
    })

    console.log(tripPatterns)
}

printTripPatterns()
```
