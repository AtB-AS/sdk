# getBikeRentalStationsByPosition

```javascript
(coordinates: Coordinates, distance?: number) => Promise<Array<BikeRentalStation>>
```

`getBikeRentalStations` finds bike rental stations within an area surrounding a coordinate.

## Parameters

### coordinates (`{ latitude: number, longitude: number }`)
The coordinates of which to find bike rental stations around.

### distance (`number`) [Optional]
Default: `500`

The "radius" in meters of the surrounding bounding box in which you want to find bike rental stations.
The width and height of the bounding box are therefore `2 * distance`, and the coordinates given are its centerpoint.
