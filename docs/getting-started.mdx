### Configuration
| Name        | Type                  | Default     | Description                             |
|:------------|:----------------------|:------------|:----------------------------------------|
| clientName  | `string`              | `undefined` | The name of your application            |
| hosts       | `{object of hosts}`   | `{}`        | Override default endpoints              |


#### clientName (required)
We require that you pass a `clientName` that identifies your application. It should contain the name of your company or organization,
followed by a hyphen and your application's name. See https://developer.entur.org/pages-intro-authentication for more information.

#### hosts
The Entur SDK uses multiple endpoints for its services. Each endpoint can be overridden with hosts config (in case you use a proxy or a local instance of the endpoint). Available hosts are:

```javascript
{
    journeyPlanner: '',
    geocoder: ''
}
```
